# Community Science Museum
Please read through this ReadMe-file before checking out this prototype version of the website and its content, for better understanding of the website's functions, navigation and its purpose. It is also recommended to read throughout the technical report or/and the process diary documentations beforehand, before visiting the website that accompanies in the submission folder of the semester project.
## Website's folders and their functions
There's some comprehensive descriptions of the folders and files for the website build on mobile-first principle and responsive design in mind. The files that belong to this folder that are not embedded in the "subfolders" of this folder are the main page (index.html) and the css files that belong to it (style.css and media.css) with a ReadMe-file. Media-file contains collections of media queries that is a css-file used to modify different screen sizes in one and same website to be embedded in all html files that exsists. 
### Assets
In this folder we can find xd-file of the "final" styletile (styletile.xd) of the website before coding, as well as XD-prototypes of the website for both mobile (mobile.xd) with 360 px width, and for desktop (desktop.xd) of 1920 px width. These folder files will help me personally to build the website's structure from the smallest display device to larger display devices, with measurements for each following element included which will be adjusted when needed. Other adjustments and changes to the webdesign in general will be documented in the technical report. 
### CSS
Here we find all css files that belongs to the html files with the same name as those css-files, which are located inside the pages-folder. While the "main" CSS-files, style.css and media.css, are located together with the index.html-file, to distinguish for myself between these main files and the "subfiles" located in the pages- and css folder while I coded this website, in order to be able to modify and customize the styling of each individual html file when needed.
### Images
This section includes all images and icons, including the logo I recreated, that will be included during website construction, which is also taken from the final xd-prototypes that are located in the assets-folder. The original images had to be resized so they would not affect too much the website's upload speed. 
#### Logo & Icons
The icon sources are taken from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) and [NounProject](https://thenounproject.com/), while the origin of the logo has been redesigned, taken from one of the vector images in the accompanying semester assignment folder we were given in this project (take a look at the process diary to see the "original logo").  
### Pages
Last folder contains all subpages of the website in html files that have their own css files (found in the css folder), which belongs to the main navigation field of the main page. The subpages that accompanies the main page consists of the following:
#### Exhibitions.html
Overview of all permanent exhibitions the museum has and arranges, where themes are placed in alphabetical order.
#### Visit.html
